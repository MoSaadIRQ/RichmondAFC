    <h1>AFC Richmond</h1>
   <br>
    <p><span>AFC Richmond </span>is a fictional English professional association football club based in Richmond upon Thames, London. They currently compete in the Premier League, the first tier of the English football league system, following promotion in 2021.

        The club was founded and played their first match <span> 1887</span> During World War I, their stadium, <span> Nelson Road </span>, was used as a field hospital.
        
        The club was owned by <span>Rupert Mannion</span> when then spouse <span>Rebecca Welton</span> seized ownership of the club outright after their divorce breakup, when he cheated with several other women behind her back - often with the help of the club's Director of Football Operations, <span>Leslie Higgins.</span>

  <h1>History</h1>

<p>When Rebecca sacked the previous coach, <span> George Cartrick</span>, she began looking for a new coach for the club in the name of <span> Ted Lasso. </span> Alongside Ted, <span>Coach Beard </span>joined and together they aimed to turn the club's lackluster season around.
    
    Their main star player was <span>Jamie Tartt</span> before he was transferred back to Manchester City F.C. , and <span>Roy Kent</span> before he retired and became one of the coaches in the club. The club managed to win several matches especially after they added new player <span> Dani Rojas</span> from Guadalajara and promoted <span> Nathan Shelley</span> as a part of the coaches team.
    
    After Jamie Tartt quit Manchester City, he returned to Richmond and became a part of the team player. After his return, several players were replaced by <span>Jan Maas</span> from Netherland. Richmond also appointed <span>Isaac McAdoo</span> as a new Captain after <span>Roy Kent</span> retired.
    
    The team lost their biggest sponsor <span>Dubai Air</span> after <span>Sam Obisanya</span> lead a boycott against the company, and in return received a new sponsor called <span>Bantr</span> as their main one. The club lost <span>Nathan Shelley</span> as the coach as he accepted a coaching job for <span>West Ham United.</span> The club was relegated after they lost to <span>Manchester City F.C.</span> but managed to bounce back and being promoted after they had a tie against <span>Brentford F.C.</span> The club manages to snatch <span>Nike</span> as their new sponsor, and their logo is being featured on their uniform sleeves.
